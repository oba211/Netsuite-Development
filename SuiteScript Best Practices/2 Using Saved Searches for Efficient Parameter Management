Using Saved Searches for Efficient Parameter Management-

Business Scenario:
Imagine a company that needs to generate sales reports based on multiple customer segments. The marketing department frequently 
requests data for various segments, such as "High Value Customers," "New Customers," and "Inactive Customers." Traditionally, 
the development team might have created multiple parameters in scripts to handle these different segments, leading to complex 
code that is difficult to maintain and update.

Proposed Solution:
Instead of hard-coding values in script or creating multiple script parameters for each customer , the development 
team can create a saved search that encompasses all relevant criteria. This saved search can be configured to filter 
customers based on various attributes (e.g., purchase history, activity status, etc.).

Benefits of Using a Saved Search:

Simplicity and Clarity: By using a single saved search, the script can remain clean and straightforward. The script only needs 
to reference the saved search instead of managing multiple parameters, which enhances readability.

Flexibility: If the marketing team requires a new segment in the future, they can simply update the saved search criteria 
without needing to alter the underlying script. This allows for quicker adjustments to business needs.

Reduced Redundancy: Having one saved search reduces duplication of logic across multiple scripts. Instead of writing similar 
filtering logic in various places, the script can leverage the saved search, promoting reusability.

Easier Maintenance: With fewer hard-coded values and parameters, the codebase becomes easier to maintain. Updates are centralized 
within the saved search, minimizing the risk of introducing bugs across multiple scripts.

Performance Optimization: Saved searches are optimized for performance within NetSuite, which can lead to improved execution 
times compared to dynamic queries in scripts.

Implementation:
The development team would create a saved search named "Customer Segmentation" with parameters for filtering the desired customer 
segments. In the SuiteScript, they would reference this saved search, passing the necessary context to retrieve the required data 
without needing multiple parameters.
