Inline list editing enables you to update records quickly by changing data directly 
in a record's row on the list page. This capability supports faster and easier editing 
because you do not have to go into each record to edit it. You can also edit multiple 
records simultaneously by using keyboard commands. Addresses cannot be edited on list 
pages using inline editing.

go to Setup > Company > Enable Features. On the Company subtab in the Data Management section, 
check the Inline Editing box and click Save.

            if (context.type === context.UserEventType.XEDIT) {
                // Avoid doing anything on Inline Edit
            }

            Whenever any record is edited inline, whether from the UI or a Script using submitFields, NetSuite 
            will trigger an xedit User Event for that record.

            The only exception to this rule is when an Inline Edit is triggered by another User Event. Actions 
            taken in User Event scripts will never trigger other User Event scripts.
